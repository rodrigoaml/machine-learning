    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "\n",
    "   - SGDClassifier - Based on SVMs\n",
    "    - `Describe one real-world application in industry where the model can be applied.`\n",
    "      - Credit card online purchases: This is a case where a considerably large number of variable are used to\n",

    "        Gradient Descent helps in the modeling of the also large dataset, necessary to have better predictor, while \n",
    "        the SVMs would play the part of \"separating\" the data, that is, what is a fraud and what is not.\n",
    "    - `What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?`\n",
    "      - The SGD can map big data sets with a reasonable training time on the opposite of SVMs.\n",
    "    - `What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?`\n",
    "      - It needs tuning, regularization, and is subject to local minimums. Also, the SVMs will start to loose performe as the number of variables exceeds the number of samples.\n",
    "    - `What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?`\n",
    "      - A SVM is capable of separating linearly inseparable ones, that is, considering the CharityML dataset, if you features that put two people on the same category but from another perspective, theey are actually in different categories.\n",
    "      \n",
    "   - Ensemble methods - Boosting with Decision Tree\n",
    "    - `Describe one real-world application in industry where the model can be applied.`\n",
    "      - Classify the safety of an area. Based on unit model, each one can learn the characteristics of a neighborhood, such as: Level of Schools and unemployement rate. To then average the answer of whether or not the place is safe. Of course that such prediction could also be done in more fuzzy way, that is, how safe a neighborhood is, but my answer it's based on decision tree classifier as the estimator.\n",
    "    - `What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?`\n",
    "      - Each unit model(weak learner) can become proficient at a single portion of the data, that is, the average of the entire ensemble should reflect the desensity of all of them, giving the majority vote.\n",
    "    - `What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?`\n",
    "      - The complexity that a given estimator may get and the nature of data, where a single classifier would be better suited, such as a Neural Network for multiclass prediction.\n",
    "    - `What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?`\n",
    "      - Given that we're looking for the most important factors that will tell whether or not a person makes more than $50K, an ensemble method can help us identify the most difficult examples to predict and use that as a basis for a production ready algorithm. That is, use the most important features to detect the income of that person.\n",
    "      \n",
    "   - Logistic regression\n",
    "    - `Describe one real-world application in industry where the model can be applied.`\n",
    "      - Predict whether or not a student can be accepted at a specific university. Given the set of variables that permeates the student life, provide an estimate of how close or far they would be related to a set of universities. This could be used by prep schools in way to assess the student strenghts and weaknesses to then build a study plan with goal of improving the acceptance chances.\n",
    "    - `What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?`\n",
    "      - Simple and fast to implement. It works as a correlation model, mostly suited for binary output problems. That is, given a probabilistic estimate, then use a threshold to determined the respective response.\n",
    "    - `What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?`\n",
    "      - It does not have the same performance for multiclass problems, where algorithms such as Neural networks, decision trees or deep learning approaches would be more suitable.\n",
    "    - `What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?`\n",
    "      - Given that we want a binary response, greater than $50K or not, and that reasonably it's a matter of correlation ( it does not mean causation but it points to a direction), logistic regression presents a good option.\n",

    "**Answer: ** The model I chose it's related to three concepts: Ensemble method, boosting and Decision trees. For you to understand the choice, we must go through each one briefly then run an real-life example. Firstly ensemble method, it's a technique that combines the creation and training of a specific number of learners, such that at the end you consult all of them, average the response and gets a final answer. Boosting it's just a way to train every new learner in the ensemble in a way that it reinforces the examples that the previous learners did not get right. Finally, a decision tree it's a type of learner that has the purpose of constructing a structure(tree), such that the answer of a question at each part of the tree leads to a new question or the final classification, e.g: If it's sunny, then, if it's not over 77F degrees, Environment is suitable for a run. It's that simple.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's consider an example. Suppose you want decide which universities to apply after high school, given that you have a set of preferences, academic statistics and financial constraints, also, you are sure of a couple of schools which to apply. As we've explained before, you'll need to train a set of learners, which in this case can be: Your friends, family members and former professors. Consider that each person will have a bias of suggesting a school for you, based on what they know you best for. A close friend might choose based on your music, sports and related interests, while a professor will base its opinion on your academic performance over the years. What you do is, go for a few \"training\" sessions with these people, by asking them about the schools you already certain about. At each time someone makes a mistake, reinforce that to the next person, by saying how important a specific interest is for you, such as a diverse environment, or scholarship purposes. What you'll get at the end is the set of people that can tell if you should or not apply to a school, and what you have to do is to average the response for new schools you want to find out about it and check what the final outcome is. That is how the model we chose for CharityML works, we train a set of learners in each feature the dataset then validate on new examples the respective outcome, that is, for each dimension that would tell if a person makes more than $50K or not, we have a learner that has an opinion about it and all of them together give us the final answer.\n",

Then you have education-level, that by itself dont't necessarily tell the income but sets ground for a minimum layer that most graduates make after school, for any given country. The occupation and workclass are basic variables that already have a priori probability of income, dependent mostly on the last feature, native-country, for a regular worker in the US might be more \"expensive\" than one in a country on Asia or South america, which is one the reasons companies such as Apple and Intel outsource the production of its products to other countries."

    "**Answer:** The features in this visualization are highly different from the one's I chose in question 6. Comparing the nature of education-num for example, seems to be more relevant given that it represents a weight over education than simply the title that a person holds. The capital-loss may point to a pattern or characteristic that a person lacks financial knowledge, which naturally would not fit as a suitable donor. Age and hours-per-week together may convey that a young person can work more given that it's also related to being educated, which at the end would mean someone very likely to make more than $50K. "

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

    "**Answer:** The score is worse. The model I chose it's based in extracting the most valuable directions from each feature to then organize them coherently, such that a logical path(decision tree) can be followed. When you remove less significant features, it introduces variance, given that the model loses complexity and can't perform as well anymore. Therefore, I would sustain the initial approach of using the entire set of features, which was limited already, to have a greater chance of exploring and finding the best solution."
